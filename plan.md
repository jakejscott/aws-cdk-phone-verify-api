What are we going to be building?

* A Phone verification service like the Twilo Verify API.
* Allows users to verify that they actually own the phone number they provide.
* Apps like Uber use phone verification to login.
* Lot's of applications are using phone numbers to provide second factor authentication (2FA). 
* It's easy to make up a fake email address when signing up for an application, but it's a bit harder to do this with a phone number.

Stuff to cover in the intro:

* Walkthrough demo of the application
* Application architecture
* Api design
* AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) getting started
